# trending-keyword-GSC-WoW

To compare week over week trending keyword nad new keyword from google search console data by daily impression. But if your site is so high SEO traffic volume your vlookup process would be get you sheet not response. So we can use pandas in Python to manipulate data fror us. And I just add googletranslate module to translate Thai keyword to English for some Expat coleage.

We need to prepare data in excel feil "last week.xlsx" and "previos week.xlsx" in the smae folder and run compare.py
